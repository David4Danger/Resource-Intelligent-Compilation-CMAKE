<h1> Resource Intelligent Compilation - CMake Edition </h1>

<p> Resource Intelligent Compilation, or 'RIC', is a design strategy that takes advantage of a small set of CUDA tools and design principles in order to easily embed CUDA code within existing C++ modules without impacting users who don't have a CUDA-enabled device. This repository servers as a demo on how to use this set of tools, and is referenced by a technical memorandum on RIC in the NASA Scientific and Technical Information reports server.</p>

<p> The full Technical Memorandum is available on the NASA Technical Reports Server: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20180003378 </p>
<p> At the present, RIC is being used to accelerate the NASA open source library 'GSAP', https://github.com/nasa/GSAP </p>
