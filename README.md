<h1> Resource Intelligent Compilation - CMake Edition </h1>

<p> Resource Intelligent Compilation, or 'RIC', is a design strategy that takes advantage of a small set of CUDA tools and design principles in order to easily embed CUDA code within existing C++ modules without impacting users who don't have a CUDA-enabled device. This repository servers as a demo on how to use this set of tools, and is referenced by the soon to be published technical memorandum on RIC in the NASA Scientific and Technical Information reports server.</p>

<p> The STI server can be found here: https://www.sti.nasa.gov/ </p>

<p> This file will be updated once the memorandum has been published. At the present, RIC is being used to accelerate the NASA open source library 'GSAP', https://github.com/nasa/GSAP </p>
